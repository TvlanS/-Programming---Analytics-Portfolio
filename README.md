# Tvlan's -Programming & Analytics Portfolio
# About
Hi, I am Tvlan, a process engineer in the oil and gas industry. As a engineer my work primarily revolves around performing calculations and studies for upstream oil and gas production processes. Beyond my engineering expertise, my passion extends to programming and data analytics which i have learned through dedicated online learning. I posses a number of certifications on the field of programming and analytics, a notable one among them include IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

My area of experience in the field of analytics and programming include Python, Django, HTML, SQL, Scikit-learn, PostgreSQL, Power BI, and more. My interests lie in leveraging automation and analytics to drive innovation and streamline operations within engineering processes.

I am looking to further develop my repeitore in this field through real world appliactions and training hence this repository serves as a showcase of my skills, a platform to share projects, and a means to track my progress regarding data analytics and programming-related projects.

# Projects
This section enlists projects that i have worked on along with a brief describing of the projects.

### Analysing payload launch data and prediciting SpaceX Falcon 9 stage 1 landing success prediction.

**Goal:** Study the launch data of the payload launches and building a predictive model to anticipate the success rate of Space X Falcon 9 stage 1 landing.

**Code:**
[`Repo Link`](https://github.com/TvlanS/SpaceX-launch-analysis-and-predictive-model/tree/main/2.0_Final_Code)

**Description:** 

This capstone project is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program. SpaceX revolutionized the rocket launch industry by offering launches for $62 million, approximately 38% less than its competitors, due to its innovative first-stage reuse capability for Falcon 9 rockets. Predicting the successful landing of a rocket's first stage is critical as it directly impacts the overall cost of a launch. This information is invaluable for our company to make competitive bids against SpaceX.

The objective of this project is to analyze historical launch data and build a predictive model to anticipate the success of first-stage landings, enabling more accurate cost forecasting and strategic decision-making.

In the initial phase of the analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to examine the number of launches, payload masses, and launch success rates across various launch sites and orbital trajectories based on historical NASA and SpaceX data. Subsequently, deeper insights were extracted through database queries, followed by an exploration of the geographical significance of each launch site using visual mapping techniques. Additionally, an interactive dashboard was developed to present these findings in an intuitive and accessible manner. Finally classification models are tested to build a predictive model to anticipate the success of the stage 1 landing. A summary on the findings is provided under the report summary section.
