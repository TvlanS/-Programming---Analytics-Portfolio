# Tvlan's -Programming & Analytics Portfolio
# About
Hi, I am Tvlan, a process engineer in the oil and gas industry. As a engineer my work primarily revolves around performing calculations and studies for upstream oil and gas production processes. Beyond my engineering expertise, my passion extends to programming and data analytics which i have learned through dedicated online learning. I posses a number of certifications on the field of programming and analytics, a notable one among them include IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

My area of experience in the field of analytics and programming include Python, Django, HTML, SQL, Scikit-learn, PostgreSQL, Power BI, and more. My interests lie in leveraging automation and analytics to drive innovation and streamline operations within engineering processes.

I am looking to further develop my repeitore in this field through real world appliactions and training hence this repository serves as a showcase of my skills, a platform to share projects, and a means to track my progress regarding data analytics and programming-related projects.

# Projects
This section enlists projects that i have worked on along with a brief describing of the projects.

**Description:** 

This is a capstone project part of the IBM data science professional certificated. SpaceX offers rocket launches for $62 million at approximately 38% of its competitorsâ€™ price , thanks to its innovative first stage reuse capability for its Falcon 9 rockets.Predicting the successful landing of the first stage of a rocket can significantly impact the overall cost of a launch, which is valuable information for our company to bid against SpaceX. Hence this project aims to study the past launch data's and built a predictive model anticipate the sucess of stage 1 landing.

In the first part of analysis , exploratory data analysis has been applied to study the number of launchest , payload masses and launch success rate on each of the launch sites and launch ordits on previous Nasa and Space X launchest. Subsequntly , more indept findings were extracted through database queries , followed with a study on the georpahical significants of each launch site using visual mapping. A das
