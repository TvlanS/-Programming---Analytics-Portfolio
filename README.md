# About
Hi there, this repo serves as a repository to showcase my skills, collobrate, and track my progress in regards to my data analytics and programming-related projects.

# Projects
This section enlists projects that i have worked on along with a brief describing of the projects.


### 1) Delivery Hub Performance (SQL)

**Objective:** Perform analysis on the performance of delivery hubs at East Malaysia based on the number of parcel processed at each hub for Company Z.

**Description:** 

Company Z has provided 4 database which are HUBS , ORDERS , SHIPPERS and SCANS . Analysis is to be performed based on the given database from 1th Dec 2024 to 25th Dec 2024. Additional , queries such as exclusion of test scans and orders of results are provided by company Z.

**Technology:** Mysql.

### 2) Web-Based Utilities Equipment Data Management and Analysis System

**Objective:** Develop a system to digitilize data management system for utility equipments along with analytic features.

**Description:** 

A web-based application designed to streamline the process of logging, reviewing, and analyzing utilities equipment data. This innovative platform is built to cater to the diverse needs of users, from field technicians to engineers, providing a comprehensive toolset for efficient data management.

Key features include:

Cost-Effectiveness: Developed to be a budget-friendly solution, making advanced data management accessible medium to small sized plants.
User-Friendly Design: With its intuitive interface, users can easily input, organize, and access data, minimizing training requirements and maximizing productivity.
Analytical Tools: Integrated features allow users to perform in-depth data analysis, uncovering trends and actionable insights to drive informed decisions.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Designed to work seamlessly on both mobile devices and web browsers, the system ensures flexibility and convenience for users in the field or the office.

### 3) Automated Image Scraping Software

**Objective:** Develop a one-click system to scrape image, resize it, and copy it to the clipboard based on the query.

**Description:** 

My endeavor to learn a new language has led to the realization that learning new words is more effective when they are associated with a relevant image. However, I quickly realized that multitasking between searching for an image on the browser and learning the word simultaneously is inefficient in terms of cognitive economy. On top of that, the copied image needs to be resized manually to a consistent size, which can become tedious. As a result, I conceptualized a one-click solution that would automate the process of selecting, copying, and resizing the image, allowing me to focus more on learning.

**Key features include:**
1.	An intuitive UI.
2.	A small window that allows for a seamless transition to other software.
3.	Automatic image resizing.
4.	Sticks to the display, eliminating the need to toggle the software back to the window while multitasking.
5.	Automatically positions itself in the corner of the screen, avoiding visual clutter.

### 4) Analysing payload launch data and prediciting SpaceX Falcon 9 stage 1 landing success prediction.

Objective: The objective of this project is to analyze historical launch data and build a predictive model to anticipate the success of first-stage landings, enabling more accurate cost forecasting and strategic decision-making.

**Description:** 

This capstone project is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program. SpaceX revolutionized the rocket launch industry by offering launches for $62 million, approximately 38% less than its competitors, due to its innovative first-stage reuse capability for Falcon 9 rockets. Predicting the successful landing of a rocket's first stage is critical as it directly impacts the overall cost of a launch. This information is invaluable for our company to make competitive bids against SpaceX.

The objective of this project is to analyze historical launch data and build a predictive model to anticipate the success of first-stage landings, enabling more accurate cost forecasting and strategic decision-making.
